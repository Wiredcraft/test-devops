# Peng Zhou's Wiredcraft DevOps Homework

I have devided the 6 tasks into 3 parts:

| #TASK    | STATUS |
| ---      | ---    |
| task.1   | DONE   |
| task.2-3 | SKIP   |
| task.4-6 | DONE   |

- DONE: I have provided a completed solution for these tasks.
- SKIP: I have no experience with the required skills, so I skipped it.

For task.4-6, I have merged them into one solution project since they have
dependencies on each other. as of task.6 I have choosen to use Jenkins to give
an example solution, for the other to CI/CD system, I have no hands on before.
