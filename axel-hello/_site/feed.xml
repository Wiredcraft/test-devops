&lt;p&gt;Dear Angry:
	Include the entire text with your article, and include your comments
between the lines.  Be sure to post, and not mail, even though your article
looks like a reply to the original.  Everybody &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; to read those long
point-by-point debates, especially when they evolve into name-calling and
lots of “Is too!” – “Is not!” – “Is too, twizot!” exchanges.
