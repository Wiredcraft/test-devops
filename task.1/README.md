# Task 1. Scripting language

Please `make` or `make help` to see all available commands.

## Design

I have split this scripting task into 5 different parts to accommondate the
lifecycle of our blog website.

1. checking the system and tools
2. initialize blog website with `hugo`, *this step should be called only once*
3. create blog post with random contents
4. [optional] preview blog webiste on localhost
5. git commit and push to a remote upstream
